# Welcome to RCJ Soccer Sim!

This is the official repository of the RoboCupJunior Soccer Simulator. The
simulator is based on [Webots](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots) and this
repository provides both the "automatic referee" (which implements the [Soccer
Simulated Rules](https://github.com/RoboCupJuniorTC/soccer-rules-simulation))
as well as a sample simulated team of robots with some basic strategy.
